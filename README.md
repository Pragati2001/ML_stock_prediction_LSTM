<p align="center">
  Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction using LSTM project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. With the power of deep learning, we aim to forecast stock prices and make informed investment decisions.

## Project Overview 💡
In this project, we leverage historical stock market data to train an LSTM model. The model learns from past price patterns and trends, enabling it to predict future stock prices. The LSTM network is specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies and has proven to be effective in time series forecasting tasks.

## Dataset 📊
We use a publicly available dataset containing historical stock prices of various companies. The dataset includes features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc. We preprocess the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and perform any necessary data transformations.🫡

## Model Training 🧑🏻‍💻
The LSTM model is built using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. We train the model on the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the learning rate. We employ techniques like regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting.Why we are using LSTM model ? It is because LSTM model follows rnn (recurrent neural network) which enables them to memorize the data from precious datasets and since the price of stock depend on its previous stock price. So thats why LSTM is beneficial.

## Evaluation and Results 📈
Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on the testing dataset. We compute model efficiency using MSE(mean sqaured error) metrics and ADAM optimizer to minimize the loss function. We visualize the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices to gain insights into the model's performance.

## Results and Discussion 📊
In this section, we present the results of our stock market prediction experiments. We evaluate the model's performance, its strengths, limitations, and potential areas of improvement. We also provide visualizations of the predicted stock prices and compare them with the actual prices.
